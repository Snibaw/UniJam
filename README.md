# UniJam
This game was created by 7 students: developers, game designers and 3D artists for a gamejam. (We won the jury prize ðŸ¥³)
It's a platformer-sandbox fps in which you can color the environment to give it effects and progress through the game.
Personally, I spent a lot of time on the game's physics and the effects of the various blocks.
